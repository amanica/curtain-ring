Description
-----------
OpenSCAD design for a simple curtain ring.
Fully parametric.

Instructions
------------
You can either use the STL provided, which will give you a 75mm diameter ring, with a 10mm thickness, or you can edit the .scad file to your own preferences.

The .scad file has the ability to lower the print by the amount specified in zcrop, say 0.3mm, which might make it a little easier to print, at a cost of symmetry.
